<- Camera ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Camera class handles the eye of the viewer.

The constructor accepts the following values:
- `origin`
	A Vertex representing the position of the camera
- `orientation
	A Matrix representing the orientation of the camera
- `ratio`
	The quotient of the screen (width/height). Note that you can
	either send the ratio argument, or both the width and height.
- `width` and `height`
	Integers representing the size of the screen.
- `fov`
	The field of view in degrees.
- `near`
	The near clipping plane of type Int.
- `far`
	The far clipping plane of type Int.

All these values have accessors for convenience.

Function:

watchVertex(Vertex $wrldVtx)
This method accepts a vertex as an argument, the one which is to be projected,
and returns the corresponding new vertex in the camera co-ordinate.
